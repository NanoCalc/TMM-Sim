**TMM Simulator** is a user-friendly software for optical simulation of thin film solar cells. By utilizing the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), it is possible to obtain crucial information of the device such as the optical electric field profile ($|E(x)|^2$), exciton generation profile $(Q(x))$, fraction of light absorbed per layer $(A(x))$, photocurrent ($J_{photo}$), external quantum efficiency ($EQE$, also know as $IPCE$, incident photon to current collection efficiency), internal quantum efficiency ($IQE$) and the parasitic losses.

The simulation tool is specifically designed to model devices that feature up to 10 stacked layers. Moreover, it offers the capability to simulate two distinct device structures: the bilayer and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures. In the bilayer structure, the active layer consist of stacked electron donor and electron acceptor materials. Conversely, the binary BHJ structure features two active layer materials that are blended throughout the film thickness. Ternary BHJ structures involve the use of three materials mixed in the active layer.

To use the TMM-Sim, one first specifies the wavelength ($\lambda$) dependent complex refractive index $\eta(\lambda)$ (optical constants) and thickness of each layer in the system. The TMM-Sim is a simple and powerful tool providing a graphical interface to facilitate its use.
